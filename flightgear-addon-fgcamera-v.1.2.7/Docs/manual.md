# Add-on usage

FlightGear virtual camera. Written in NASAL. Adds features similar to Ezdok
Camera Addon for FSX. User can define it's own view configuration (position
inside/outside the aircraft, look-at and zoom). One can switch between them
using keyboard shortcuts 0-9.

FGCamera covers also dynamic head movement according to defined values and random
movement generator which can simulate any aircraft type (GA, Airliner etc).

# Installation

- extract zip (if downloaded as a zip) to a given location. For example let's
  say we have `/myfolder/addons/fgcamera` with contents of this addon.
- add path to the addon in the Launcher application in 'Add-On' section **OR**
  run FlightGear with `--addon` option with path to FGCamera like
  `--addon="/myfolder/addons/fgcamera"`.

# FlightGear configuration

Start FlightGear. Go to menu `View -> FGCamera`. FGCamera default configuration
window will appear.

![alt menu](images/menu-view.png "Add-on menu")

First top section has following buttons:

* '**Import...**' button allows you to load a camera preset for a specific aircraft.
This is a good option for a start, where you don't have to create cameras from
scratch, and you can always modify the loaded set. More in the
[Camera Presets](#camera-presets) section.
* '**New camera...**' button for create a new camera. More in the
[Creating new camera](#creating-new-camera) section.
* '**Options...**' button show global options for FGCamera. More in the
[General options](#general-options) section.

In the next section, FGCamera lists all camera configurations with it's camera
shortcut and default camera group. In the example we have 'default' camera, which
is connected with the `1` key on the keyboard. The default camera is in the group
`[0]`. The arrow sign `<-` indicates the currently selected camera.

You can change order of the selected camera by using '**Up**' and '**Dn**' buttons.

In the bottom you have 'Current camera' section with controls assigned to selected camera:
* input text field to change the name of the selected camera,
* combobox to change current group of the selected camera (thanks to this you will
be able to switch between cameras of the same group only using a mini-dialogue),
* '**Copy camera**' button to create a new camera by copying the current one.
* '**Confirm position**' button, which you have to click after changing the
position and rotation of the camera, to store the position and not lose it when
switching to another camera. **NOTE! This is needed to clearly indicate that you
want to change the camera position and not that you were just looking around**.
* '**Config...**' button to access current camera configuration (see [Camera configuration](#camera-configuration) section),
* '**Delete...**' button to delete the selected camera.

![alt camera-main](images/camera-main.png "FGCamera main dialog")

## Camera Presets

FGCamera contains a list of ready-made cameras for different aircraft. If you do
not want to create a camera set from scratch, you can click the 'Import...'
button. A new window will appear with a list of available cameras for different
aircraft.

![alt camera-presets](images/camera-presets.png "Camera Presets")

Find your current aircraft, select it by clicking on it and click the
'**Load selected**' button. The list of cameras in your main window will be
replaced. However, this configuration will not be permanently saved to disk, so
you must click the 'Save' or 'Save & close' button to make it permanent. Saving
does not mean changing the presets, they will always remain unchanged, as part
of the add-on, always ready to be loaded again. See also
[Saving changes](#saving-changes) section.

You can always edit and customize the loaded cameras and save them for your
aircraft.

## Creating new camera

Using 'New camera...' brings the default dialog for creating it. There
you can select camera type and define camera name.

![alt create-new-camera](images/create-new-camera.png "Create new camera")

Camera types are as follows:

* '**cockpit**' - view from cockpit
* '**aircraft (look at)**' - view on aircraft
* '**aircraft (look from)**' - view from the aircraft to the outside world
* '**world (look at)**' - any perspective
* '**world (look from)**' - any perspective

![alt camera-type](images/camera-type.png "Camera type")

After selecting camera type and its name, the new camera is created. By default
it has camera coordination as current user camera. Thus you can select camera
and next create camera, which would have this camera as predefined. Other camera
options that don't concern position are taken from the default-cameras.xml file.
If you want to create a new camera as an exact copy of an existing one, select
the camera you want to copy and click the 'Copy camera' button in the 'Current
camera' section of the 'FGCamera' main window.

## General options

Clicking '**Options...**' button you can define behavior of following options:

![alt options](images/options.png "Options")

* Mouse
  * '**Press and hold right mouse to look around in FGCamera**' - FGCamera changes
  the right mouse button behavior to 'Click right mouse to cycle mouse behavior'
  (see `File -> Mouse Configuration`). Therefore, check this option if you want
  to look around while holding down the right mouse button. By default, this
  option is enabled.
  * '**Force "Press and hold right mouse to look around" in FG views**' - Using
  FGCamera, you can always switch to FlightGear's default views using the v/V
  key. Check this option if you would like to look around in this mode by
  holding  down the right mouse button. By default, this option is enabled.
* Mini-dialog
  * '**Enable mini-dialog**' - enable/disable displaying the mini-dialog, in the
  lower left corner of the screen. Enabled by default.
  * '**Mini-dialog type**' - you can choose a '**simple**' mini-dialog or
  '**slots**' which additionally includes 0 to 9 buttons for changing cameras.
  By default, 'simple' mini-dialog is using.
  * '**Auto hide mini-dialog**' - enabling this option will cause that by default
  the mini-dialog will be hidden, only pointing the mouse cursor to the lower
  left corner of the screen will display the mini-dialog. By default, this
  option is disable.
* Key
  * '**Use Ctrl with numeric key**' - by default, FGCamera overrides the default
  number key assignments, 0 to 9, using them to switch between cameras. This
  means you won't be able to use the number keys to control the aircraft, such
  as the 5 key to return the controls to neutral position, etc. Then you can
  enable this option to make FGCamera override the number keys with the Ctrl key
  held down. Then FlightGear's default number keys will work, and switching
  between cameras will be done with Ctrl-0 to Ctrl-9. By default, this option is
  disabled.
* Extra handlers - these handlers are optional and most users don't need them,
  so they are disabled by default. However, you can always enable them as needed.
  * '**Linux Track**' - enable/disable Linux Track handler.
  * '**TrackIR**' - enable/disable TrackIR handler.
* Buttons
  * '**Save**' - save all camera configurations and options to a file and close
  the window. NOTE! This button works like 'Save' in the main 'FGCamera' window,
  i.e. it also saves the cameras.
  * '**Close**' - just close the window (without saving to disk).

## Mini-dialogs

FGCamera also offers two mini-dialogs to quickly switch between cameras using the mouse.

### 'Simple' mini-dialog

This window contains 4 buttons:

* `<<`, `>>` - these buttons are used to switch between camera groups,
* `<`, `>` - these buttons are used to switch between cameras in the current camera group only,
* `R` - reset button to switch to default camera assigned to key `1`.

![alt mini-dialog-simple](images/mini-dialog-simple.png "Mini-dialog simple")

### 'Slots' mini-dialog

This window displays the same buttons as the 'simple' variant, plus includes
additional buttons from 0 to 9, with which you can select a specific camera.

![alt mini-dialog-slots](images/mini-dialog-slots.png "Mini-dialog slots")

## Keyboard shortcuts

* Ctrl-Up / Ctrl-Down - move current camera to forward / backward.
* Ctrl-Left / Ctrl-Right - move current camera to left / right.
* Ctrl-PageUp / Ctrl-PageDown - move current camera to up / down.
* 0, 1, 2, ... 9 - selecting predefined cameras views or Ctrl-0, Ctrl-1, ...
  Ctrl-9 if `Use Ctrl with numeric key` options is enabled.
* Ctrl-Space - toggle aircraft control by mouse.

## Camera configuration

![alt camera-config](images/camera-config.png "Current Camera Config")

Camera setting has different options regarding current selected camera. Available
options:

* '**Show popup tip with camera name**' - when selecting it, the popup will
  show with selected camera name.
* '**Show 2D panel**' - display 2D panel with the selection of this camera. You
  can also choose between two panels to show (see next paragraph).
* '**Show dialog**'- display any FG dialog with the selection of this camera. First,
  type the name of the dialog, such as `map` for map display, then check the
  checkbox. To find the available dialog names in FlightGear, use '**...**'
  (browse) button. However, the aircraft may have additional dialogs defined. To
  find out what they are named, search the aircraft source code for the keyword
  "dialog-name".
* '**Field of view**' - default field of view in degrees. If you want a wider field
  of view, use a larger value. Default is 65 degrees.
* '**View movement**' - duration of the transition animation (in seconds) from the
  previous camera to the current one. Default is 1 second.
* '**View movement/adjustment**' - options for selecting/animating transition between
  views.
* '**Mouse look**' - options for current mouse look (sensitivity etc.)

When selecting 2D panel you can choose between two ready-made panels. One with
default controls/gauges for VFR flight control and one with only physical control
display with throttle.

![alt generic-vfr-panel](images/generic-vfr-panel.png "VFR panel - generic")

![alt controls-vfr-panel](images/controls-vfr-panel.png "VFR panel - controls only")

On the 'Current Camera Config' dialog, there are two buttons at the bottom:

1. '**DHM...**' for options regarding 'Dynamic Head Movement'
2. '**RND...**' for Random movement generator.
3. '**Nasal...**' for enter any Nasal scripts to be run on entry and leave of the current camera.

## Dynamic Head Movement

When selecting 'DHM' on the camera setting dialog, user is moved to the options
regarding dynamic head movement. There you can define various options regarding
this effect. When enabled and configured the camera will move according to
defined options the same as normally would move the head of the pilot in the
aircraft.

![alt dhm](images/dhm.png "Dynamic Head Movement")

## Random View Generator

When selecting '**RND**' on the Current Camera Config dialog, one is moved to the Random
View Generator dialog. There you can define predefined random movement. This
option can simulate various aircraft and situations. When selecting 'Import'
button, you can import predefined Random setting according to plane types e.g.
for General Aircraft (GA) type. Using Ground/Air buttons you can define different
random generator according to the aircraft state (in Air/on the Ground).

![alt random-main-window](images/random-main.png "Random - main window")

When pressing '**Generator 1...**', 2, 3 button you can define additional random
signal generators, that can feed the data to main random generator engine.

![alt generator](images/generator-1.png "Generator")

When pressing '**Curves**' button, you can define additional output gain
regarding velocity in knots.

![alt random-main-window](images/random-main.png "Random - main window")

## Execute Nasal Script

Clicking the '**Nasal**' button in the Current Camera dialog will open a new window for entering Nasal scripts.

![alt execute-nasal-script](images/execute-nasal-script.png "Execute Nasal Script")

This window is divided into two parts. In the upper part we can enter a script to be executed upon entry to the current camera. In the lower part we can enter a script to exit the current camera.

Each part has a checkbox, checking it means enabling the script execution. This way you can control which scripts are executed, independently from the main checkbox in the Current Camera Config dialog.

The example in the image above comes from a Cessna 172P, where when entering the camera we have a script that turns on the flashlight (if ALS is enabled) and when leaving the camera we have the flashlight turned off.

Writing a script in the GUI of the current version of FlightGear is very inconvenient, so for each editor field we have the following buttons:

* '**Copy**' - copy the script from the editor to the clipboard;
* '**Paste**' - paste the script from the clipboard to the editor;
* '**Clear**' - remove everything that the editor window contains.

For writing scripts I recommend using an external editor and here using only the above buttons.

## Saving changes

Each change of the camera position (such as moving with the Ctrl-{arrow keys},
or Ctrl-PgUp/PgDn, or changing the viewing direction with the mouse) must be
confirmed with the 'Confirm position' button in the 'Current camera'
section. Then the changes will be store for current camera but in the RAM only.

To save changes permanently to disk, click the '**Save & close**' or '**Save**'
button in the main 'FGCamera' dialog. The 'Save & close' button simultaneously
closes the 'FGCamera' dialog. The 'Save' button only saves the changes and
leaves the 'FGCamera' dialog open.

Every configuration is saved with the current aircraft settings.
Settings regarding each aircraft are stored in
`$FG_HOME/aircraft-data/FGCamera/{aircraft name}/` directory.

* See [`aircraft-integration.md`](./aircraft-integration.md) file for additional API for integration with the
aircraft code in order to get more precise control e.g. walker bypass options
* See [`headtracker-integration.md`](./headtracker-integration.md) file for information how to integrate additional
head-tracker interfaces (beside Linux Track and TrackIR.)

Have fun using this addon!
